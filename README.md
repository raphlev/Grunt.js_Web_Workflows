Developing a workflow will help you program, test, and deploy your web applications more easily and efficiently. Tools like Grunt.js make generating workflows as easy as writing a setup file. Here Ray Villalobos covers the key steps in creating a Grunt-based web workflow, from creating tasks to process Sass and combine scripts to automating the entire workflow. He also shows how to use Bower.io to quickly load frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Mustache.js.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspod to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
